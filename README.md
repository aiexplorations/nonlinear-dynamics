# Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos

A repo for exploring nonlinear dynamics, chaos, fractals and related topics using Python code.

# Dynamical Systems Visualizer

The dynamical systems visualizer is a small app within this repo which can be run on Docker containers. It has great potential to model and visualize all kinds of chaotic and dynamical systems that can be described in two or three dimensions.

## Frontend

The frontend of the dynamical systems visualizer is built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes popular frameworks like React or Angular to create a responsive and interactive user interface. The frontend is responsible for rendering the visualizations, handling user inputs, and communicating with the backend.

## Backend

The backend of the dynamical systems visualizer is implemented using a server-side programming language such as Python, Node.js, or Java. It handles the business logic, data processing, and serves as the intermediary between the frontend and the data sources. The backend is responsible for fetching the required data, performing calculations, and providing the necessary APIs for the frontend to consume.

## Docker

Docker is used to containerize the dynamical systems visualizer application. It allows for easy deployment and scalability by packaging the frontend, backend, and their dependencies into separate containers. Docker provides a consistent environment for running the application, ensuring that it behaves the same across different platforms and environments. With Docker, the dynamical systems visualizer can be easily deployed on various cloud platforms or on-premises servers.

# Future Developments

Code in the scripts folder provides a way to build common visualization capabilities which can then be re-used for different kinds of dynamical systems. This has to be applied to make existing code more modular.

A few tests and better logging need to be implemented.

More dynamical systems have to be brought into this app.
